# Activities

## Conflict of Interest (COI) disclosure policy

## Survey of *CD* first authors 

From a six-month period in 2016-2018, $n=36$ authors contacted and $n=24$ responded.

---

| Question                        | Early career | Senior |
|---------------------------------|--------------|--------|
| Any prior experience with posting/sharing data? | 40% | 30% |
| Does your institution provide resources for preparation/posting of data? | 80% | 80% |

---

| What, if any, of the below concerns do you have about data sharing if *CD* were to require data from published studies be made available to other researchers?  | Early career | Senior |
|-----------------------------------|--------------|--------|
| IRB | 50% | 89% |
| Jeopardizing trust of participants/communities/violating consent | 90% | 77% |
| Risk of scooping planned research | 50% | 56% |
| Taking time away from my research | 50% | 56% |

<small>Concerns rated lower in importance: financial cost, fairness/equal partnership, trust in collaboration beyond data sharing.</small>

## Policy statement (adopted 2018-10-26)

---

> "*The advancement of detailed and diverse knowledge about the development of the world’s children is essential for improving the health and well-being of humanity..."

> "*We regard scientific integrity, transparency, and openness as essential for the conduct of research and its application to practice and policy..."

## Guidelines to *Child Development* authors

- Adapted from [Center for Open Science (COS)](http://cos.io) [Transparency & Openness Promotion (TOP) Guidelines](https://cos.io/our-services/top-guidelines/)
- Sections concerning
    - Research Materials Transparency
    - Design and Analysis Transparency
    - Data and Analytic Methods (Code) Transparency
    - Citation Standards
    - Preregistration of Studies and Analysis Plans
    - Replication

# Researcher concerns

## Increase in risks to participants

- Do participants understand risks?
- Can confidentiality of shared data be protected?
- Unforseeable risks of 'indefinite' storage?
- Can data be truly 'de-identified'?

## Problems for ethics review

- Must minors be reconsented when they reach adulthood?
- Can future secondary uses be adequately described?
- Differences among developed/developing world, U.S. vs. Europe, etc.

## Burdens on researchers

- Preparing data & materials to share takes time
- Inconsistent institutional infrastructure & support
- Unfair burden on researchers with limited resources?
- Who bears cost of curation?

## Risks to researchers

- Other researchers will 'scoop' original data collectors
- Errors will become more readily known and possibly subject to criticism
- Early adopters will face the brunt

## Risks to researchers

- Openness not yet a widespread criterion for promotion
- Is 'openness' more important than other evaluative criteria?

## Burdens on reviewers, editors, & publishers

- Must shared analysis code be reviewed alongside manuscript?
- Must publishers provide infrastructure for sharing?

## Restrictions on scientific innovation & impact

- Mandating preregistration may limit exploratory analyses
- Do multiple uses of the same data increase the risk of false positive findings
- Does emphasizing openness devalue diverse modes of scholarship?

# Meeting (many of) the concerns

## Minimizing risks to participants

- Do no harm!
- Seek explicit consent to share using standard template language
- Use existing data repositories that offer restricted data sharing
    - [Databrary](http://databrary.org), [ICPSR](http://icspsr.umich.edu)
- Consider restricted data sharing even for 'de-identified' data

## Minimizing burdens on researchers

- Prepare to share to avoid *post hoc* hassles
- Use and support 'free' data repositories (Databrary, ICSPR, OSF)
- Learn to use reproducible workflows and tools (RMarkdown; Jupyter notebooks)

## Minimizing risks to researchers

- Require citation of data & materials
- Criticing the work vs. criticizing the worker
- Recommending, but not requiring materials, data, code sharing

## Minimizing burdens on reviewers, editors, & publishers

- Review of materials, data, code optional
- Possible partnerships with data repositories

## Minimizing negative impacts on scientific impact & innovation

- Sharing, preregistration, replication recommended and publicized but not required
- Embracing diversity in scholarship
